RDF2RDFa-izer
=============

RDF2RDFa-izer is currently a deadly simple web frontend of the RDFa Serializer plugin[1] (written by Keith Alexander[2]) for ARC[3], a Semantic Web Framework 
written in PHP. Its currently functionality is only to take a RDF/XML document as input and serialize it as (X)HTML+RDFa snippet that can be inserted into a
(X)HTML+RDFa document.
Further extensions of the existing RDFa Serializer plugin for ARC are imaginable. Some ideas are:

- title/label (/comment/description) extraction of the RDF terms for a better readability
- templates that are applied when the instance data is typed with a specific universal e.g., foaf:PersonalProfileDocument

Feel free to contribute to this project.
